# Lecture Analyzer
Python-based web application geared to those who have trouble hearing and understanding lectures. Using OpenAI's Whisper, the website will summarize and/or transcribe lectures when provided with an mp3 recording. In the future, I might work towards creating a captioning program and utilize it to make platforms like YouTube more accessible.

As for now, you can access the web application at https://lectureanalyzer.pythonanywhere.com/

# Captioning program
